As TMXlib is really young, it is a little bit hardcoded and some parts should be improved.
In addition, a lot of features would be added in order to provide a complete and easy-use library for tmx files.

TODO List

* Code & Best-practices
-> Exhaustive tests
-> Move semantics
-> Examples

Well, let's sum up : const-correctness, abstract parser (in order to avoid boost), in-memory loader, common base for layers, and for objects in general, complete examples

* Features
-> Wrappers for SFML and (maybe) SDL
-> Multithread loading
-> Type-erasure for layers, objectgroups and imagelayer to conserv order
