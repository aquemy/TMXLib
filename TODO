As TMXlib is really young, it is a little bit hardcoded and some parts should be improved.
In addition, a lot of features would be added in order to provide a complete and easy-use library for tmx files.

TODO List

* Code & Best-practices
-> Exhaustive tests
-> Move semantics
-> Examples

* Features
-> Wrappers for SFML and (maybe) SDL
-> Multithread loading
-> Features related to the new version of tiled
-> Mac OS X support
-> Parser abstraction to have more flexibility
